  <h2>Privacy Policy (Datenschutzerklärung)</h2>

  <p>
    We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. This website uses <strong>Matomo</strong>, a self-hosted open-source web analytics platform, to help us understand how visitors interact with the site.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Collection and Processing</h3>
  <p>
    Matomo is configured to be privacy-friendly:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Self-hosted:</strong> All data is stored on our own server in Germany. No data is shared with third parties or Matomo's developers.</li>
    <li><strong>IP Anonymization:</strong> Your IP address is anonymized (e.g., 192.168.xxx.xxx) so that it cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
    <li><strong>No Cookies:</strong> We have disabled the use of tracking cookies in Matomo. No cookies are stored on your device for analytics purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> We respect your browser's "Do Not Track" (DNT) settings. If DNT is enabled, your visit will not be tracked at all.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice form analytics:</strong> When you use the practice form, we record the entered characters and the selected language/script options (Mandarin/Cantonese and simplified/traditional) as Matomo event data to understand usage patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Local Storage</h3>
  <p>
    The website uses browser <code>sessionStorage</code> to remember your character selections while you navigate the site. This data is stored only on your device and is deleted when you close your browser tab or window.
  </p>

  <h3>Your Rights</h3>
  <p>
    You have the right to request information about the data we have stored about you, as well as the right to have it corrected or deleted. Since we do not store any personally identifiable information (due to IP anonymization and no cookies), we generally cannot link any analytics data to a specific person.
